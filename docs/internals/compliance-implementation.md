# Compliance Architecture

Kimberlite is built for healthcare workloads — EHR/EMR, payer/RCM, clinical research, digital health — where data integrity, auditability, and provable correctness are non-negotiable for HIPAA compliance, BAA fulfillment, and patient subject-access requests. This document describes the compliance-related architecture: audit trails, cryptographic guarantees, encryption, and regulatory support (HIPAA-native; GDPR / SOC 2 / ISO 27001 as overlay frameworks).

## Overview

Kimberlite provides **compliance by construction**, not compliance by configuration. The architecture makes certain violations impossible:

| Guarantee | How It's Achieved |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Immutability** | Append-only log; no UPDATE or DELETE on raw events |
| **Auditability** | Every state change is logged with metadata |
| **Tamper Evidence** | Cryptographic hash chain links all events |
| **Non-Repudiation** | Events can be signed with Ed25519 |
| **Data Sovereignty** | Regional placement enforced at routing layer |
| **Isolation** | Per-tenant encryption keys |
| **Retention** | Legal holds prevent deletion; configurable retention |
| **Reconstruction** | Any point-in-time state derivable from log |
| **No Duplicates** | Transaction-level idempotency IDs prevent double-processing |
| **Recovery Transparency** | Explicit logging of any data discarded during recovery |

### Supported Frameworks

Kimberlite is HIPAA-native — the architecture, types, and audit chain are designed around the Privacy Rule, Security Rule, and Breach Notification Rule. Other frameworks below are overlays whose requirements compose with HIPAA when an operator opts in.

| Framework | Role | Key Requirements | Kimberlite Support |
|-----------|------|------------------|------------------|
| **HIPAA** | Native | Audit trails, access controls, encryption, Safe Harbor de-id, BAA | Full |
| **21 CFR Part 11** | Native | Electronic records, signatures, timestamps (clinical research) | Full |
| **HITECH** | Native | Breach notification, audit log integrity | Full |
| **GDPR** | Overlay | Right to erasure, data portability, consent (EU patients) | Full |
| **SOC 2** | Overlay | Security, availability, processing integrity | Full |
| **ISO 27001** | Overlay | ISMS, risk management, access controls | Full |
| **CCPA / CPRA** | Overlay | Subject access, deletion, opt-out (California patients) | Full |

The same architectural primitives—immutable logs, hash chaining, encryption, and audit trails—satisfy HIPAA outright and compose with overlay frameworks when needed.

## Transaction Idempotency for Compliance

In regulated industries, duplicate transactions (e.g., double-charging a patient, double-booking a trade) are compliance violations. Kimberlite prevents duplicates through transaction-level idempotency.

### The Problem

Network failures can cause clients to retry without knowing if the original succeeded:

```
Client                    Server
  │                          │
  │  Transaction (ID: abc)   │
  ├─────────────────────────►│  ← Server commits
  │                          │
  │     (network failure)    │  ← Response lost
  │      ◄───────X───────    │
  │                          │
  │  Retry (ID: abc)         │
  ├─────────────────────────►│  ← Without idempotency: DUPLICATE!
  │                          │     With idempotency: Return original result
```

### How Kimberlite Prevents Duplicates

Every transaction includes a client-generated idempotency ID:

```rust
// Client generates ID before first attempt
let idempotency_id = IdempotencyId::generate();

// First attempt
let result = client.execute_with_id(idempotency_id, transaction).await;

// If network fails, retry with SAME ID
let result = client.execute_with_id(idempotency_id, transaction).await;
// Returns same result without re-executing
```

### Commitment Proof

Clients can query whether a transaction committed:

```rust
/// Query the commitment status of a transaction.
/// Returns cryptographic proof suitable for audit.
pub struct CommitmentProof {
    /// The idempotency ID that was queried
    pub idempotency_id: IdempotencyId,
    /// Log offset where transaction was committed (if any)
    pub offset: Option<Offset>,
    /// Timestamp of commitment
    pub committed_at: Option<Timestamp>,
    /// Hash at the committed offset (for verification)
    pub hash: Option<Hash>,
}
```

This proof is essential for compliance:
- **Dispute resolution**: Prove a transaction did or did not occur
- **Audit trail**: Link business events to log positions
- **Recovery**: Verify state after system recovery

### Compliance Implications

| Requirement | How Idempotency Helps |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **No duplicate records** | Retries return existing result, not new record |
| **Audit accuracy** | Each business event maps to exactly one log entry |
| **Dispute resolution** | Commitment proof provides cryptographic evidence |
| **Recovery verification** | Clients can verify transactions survived recovery |

## Recovery Audit Trail

Kimberlite explicitly tracks what data might have been lost during recovery, providing complete transparency for compliance.

### Generation-Based Recovery

Each recovery event creates a new "generation" with an explicit record:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Recovery Audit Trail                                             │
│                                                                  │
│  Generation 1: Normal operation                                  │
│  ├─ Offset 0-4950: Committed and acknowledged                   │
│  ├─ Offset 4951-5000: Prepared but not committed               │
│  └─ Recovery triggered: QuorumLoss                              │
│                                                                  │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │ RECOVERY RECORD (logged to audit trail)                     │ │
│  │                                                             │ │

│  │   recovery_point: 4950                                      │ │
│  │   discarded_range: Some(4951..5001)  ← EXPLICIT LOSS        │ │

│  └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                                                  │
│  Generation 2: Normal operation continues                        │

│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What Gets Recorded

| Field | Description | Compliance Use |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| `generation` | New generation number | Correlate events to recovery epochs |
| `previous_generation` | Prior generation | Chain of custody |
| `known_committed` | Last definitely-committed offset | Data loss boundary |
| `recovery_point` | Where log continues | Gap identification |
| `discarded_range` | Offsets that were discarded | **Explicit loss reporting** |
| `timestamp` | When recovery occurred | Incident timeline |
| `reason` | Why recovery was triggered | Root cause analysis |

### Regulatory Reporting

The explicit `discarded_range` enables precise incident reporting:

```rust
// Generate compliance report for data loss incident
fn generate_loss_report(recovery: &RecoveryRecord) -> IncidentReport {
    match &recovery.discarded_range {
        Some(range) => IncidentReport {
            occurred_at: recovery.timestamp,
            affected_records: range.end - range.start,
            first_affected_offset: range.start,
            last_affected_offset: range.end - 1,
            reason: recovery.reason.description(),
            remediation: "Affected clients notified; transactions can be retried",
        },
        None => IncidentReport {
            occurred_at: recovery.timestamp,
            affected_records: 0,
            // Clean recovery - no data loss
            remediation: "No action required",
        },
    }
}
```

### Compliance Framework Mapping

| Framework | Requirement | How Recovery Tracking Helps |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **HIPAA** | Report breaches affecting 500+ individuals | `discarded_range` gives exact count |
| **SOC 2** | Processing integrity controls | Recovery records prove data handling |
| **GDPR** | Document data processing activities | Complete audit trail of all recovery events |
| **21 CFR Part 11** | Audit trail for electronic records | Generation transitions logged with timestamps |

---

## Audit Trail Architecture

Every state change in Kimberlite is captured in the append-only log with full metadata.

### Timestamp Guarantees

Kimberlite uses **wall-clock timestamps with monotonic guarantees** for audit trail compliance:

```rust
pub struct Timestamp(u64);  // Nanoseconds since Unix epoch

impl Timestamp {
    /// Create timestamp ensuring monotonicity within the system.
    /// Returns max(current_wall_clock, last_timestamp + 1ns).
    pub fn now_monotonic(last: Option<Timestamp>) -> Timestamp;
}
```

**Why wall-clock?** Regulatory frameworks require human-readable timestamps:
- HIPAA audit logs must show when records were accessed/modified
- Legal discovery references calendar dates and times
- 21 CFR Part 11 requires accurate timestamps for electronic signatures

**Why monotonic?** Prevents ordering anomalies:
- Clock skew or NTP adjustments could produce out-of-order timestamps
- Monotonicity ensures `event[n].timestamp >= event[n-1].timestamp`
- Worst case: multiple events share the same timestamp (still ordered by position)

**Implementation**: `max(now(), last_timestamp + 1ns)` - if wall clock goes backwards, increment by 1ns instead.

### Event Metadata

Each event includes:

```rust
struct EventMetadata {
    /// Unique position in the log
    position: LogPosition,

    /// When the event was committed (wall clock, monotonic within system)
    timestamp: Timestamp,

    /// Which tenant owns this data
    tenant_id: TenantId,

    /// Which stream within the tenant
    stream_id: StreamId,

    /// Who initiated this change (user, system, API key)
    actor: ActorId,

    /// What caused this event (request ID, correlation ID)
    caused_by: Option<CorrelationId>,

    /// Client IP address (if applicable)
    client_ip: Option<IpAddr>,

    /// Type of operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
    operation: OperationType,
}
```

### Audit Queries

Query the audit trail directly:

```sql
-- All changes to a specific record
SELECT * FROM __events
WHERE stream = 'records'
  AND data->>'id' = '123'
ORDER BY position ASC;

-- All changes by a specific user
SELECT * FROM __events
WHERE actor = 'user:alice@example.com'
  AND timestamp > '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;

-- All deletions in a time range
SELECT * FROM __events
WHERE operation = 'DELETE'
  AND timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-02-01';
```

### What Gets Logged

| Operation | Logged Data |
|-----------|-------------|
| INSERT | Full record, actor, timestamp, correlation |
| UPDATE | Old values, new values, actor, timestamp |
| DELETE | Deleted values, actor, timestamp, reason |
| QUERY | Query text, actor, timestamp (configurable) |
| SCHEMA CHANGE | DDL statement, actor, timestamp |
| ACCESS | Record accessed, actor, timestamp (configurable) |

---

## Hash Chaining

Every event is cryptographically linked to its predecessor, creating a tamper-evident chain.

### How It Works

```
Event 0         Event 1         Event 2         Event 3
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐
│ data    │     │ data    │     │ data    │     │ data    │
│         │     │         │     │         │     │         │
│ prev: ──┼──┐  │ prev: ──┼──┐  │ prev: ──┼──┐  │ prev: ──┼──┐
│ 00000   │  │  │ a3f2c   │  │  │ 7b1d4   │  │  │ e9c8a   │  │
│         │  │  │         │  │  │         │  │  │         │  │
│ hash:   │  │  │ hash:   │  │  │ hash:   │  │  │ hash:   │  │
│ a3f2c ◄─┼──┘  │ 7b1d4 ◄─┼──┘  │ e9c8a ◄─┼──┘  │ f2b7d   │
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────┘
```

Each event's hash includes:
1. The previous event's hash
2. The event's position
3. The event's timestamp
4. The event's data

### Hash Computation

```rust
fn compute_event_hash(prev_hash: &Hash, event: &Event) -> Hash {
    use sha2::{Sha256, Digest};
    let mut hasher = Sha256::new();
    hasher.update(prev_hash.as_bytes());
    hasher.update(&event.position.to_le_bytes());
    hasher.update(&event.timestamp.to_le_bytes());
    hasher.update(&event.data);
    hasher.finalize().into()
}
```

### Tamper Detection

If any event is modified, all subsequent hashes become invalid:

```rust
fn verify_hash_chain(log: &Log) -> Result<(), ChainError> {
    let mut prev_hash = Hash::zero();

    for event in log.iter() {
        let expected_hash = compute_event_hash(&prev_hash, &event);

        if event.hash != expected_hash {
            return Err(ChainError::TamperDetected {
                position: event.position,
                expected: expected_hash,
                actual: event.hash,
            });
        }

        prev_hash = event.hash;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

### Verification Guarantees

| Attack | Detected? | How? |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Modify event | Yes | Hash mismatch |
| Delete event | Yes | Gap in positions + hash chain break |
| Insert event | Yes | Position conflict + hash chain break |
| Reorder events | Yes | Hash chain break |
| Truncate log | Partial | Missing events (if expected count known) |

### Verified Reads with Checkpoints

For production workloads, verifying from genesis on every read is too expensive. Checkpoints provide verification anchors that bound the cost:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Verified Read: Without vs With Checkpoints                       │
│                                                                  │
│ WITHOUT CHECKPOINTS (O(n)):                                      │
│ Read offset 5000 → verify 5000 → 4999 → ... → 0 (genesis)       │
│                    [5000 hash checks]                            │
│                                                                  │
│ WITH CHECKPOINTS (O(k) where k = records since checkpoint):      │
│ Read offset 5000 → find checkpoint at 4500                       │
│                  → verify 5000 → 4999 → ... → 4500 (stop)       │
│                    [500 hash checks]                             │
│                                                                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Checkpoint trust model**:
- Checkpoints are log records (in the hash chain, tamper-evident)
- A checkpoint is trusted if previously verified to genesis
- Full genesis verification runs periodically (e.g., nightly) or on-demand
- Interactive reads verify only from the nearest checkpoint

**Verification levels**:

| Level | When Used | Verification Scope |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Full** | Nightly job, audit export, startup | Genesis to tip |
| **Checkpoint** | Normal reads (default) | Nearest checkpoint to target |
| **None** | Read-only analytics replicas | Trust projection state |

**Compliance note**: For audit exports and regulator-facing proofs, always use full verification. Checkpoint verification is a performance optimization for interactive reads where the underlying chain has been fully verified.

---

## Cryptographic Sealing

For high-assurance environments, Kimberlite supports cryptographically sealed checkpoints.

### Checkpoint Structure

Periodically, the system creates a signed checkpoint:

```rust
struct SealedCheckpoint {
    /// Log position this checkpoint covers
    through_position: LogPosition,

    /// Hash of the event at through_position
    log_hash: Hash,

    /// Merkle root of all projection state
    projection_hash: Hash,

    /// Wall clock time of seal
    sealed_at: Timestamp,

    /// Ed25519 signature over the above
    signature: Signature,

    /// Public key that created the signature
    signer: PublicKey,
}
```

### Sealing Process

```rust
fn create_sealed_checkpoint(
    log: &Log,
    projections: &ProjectionStore,
    signing_key: &SigningKey,
) -> SealedCheckpoint {
    let position = log.last_position();
    let log_hash = log.get(position).unwrap().hash;
    let projection_hash = projections.merkle_root();
    let sealed_at = Timestamp::now();

    let message = [
        position.to_le_bytes().as_slice(),
        log_hash.as_bytes(),
        projection_hash.as_bytes(),
        &sealed_at.to_le_bytes(),
    ].concat();

    let signature = signing_key.sign(&message);

    SealedCheckpoint {
        through_position: position,
        log_hash,
        projection_hash,
        sealed_at,
        signature,
        signer: signing_key.verifying_key(),
    }
}
```

### Third-Party Attestation

For regulatory requirements, checkpoints can be attested by external parties:

1. **Timestamping Authority**: Checkpoint hash submitted to RFC 3161 TSA
2. **Blockchain Anchoring**: Checkpoint hash anchored to public blockchain
3. **Auditor Signature**: External auditor co-signs checkpoint

## Per-Tenant Encryption

Each tenant's data is encrypted with a unique key hierarchy.

### Key Hierarchy

### Encryption Algorithm

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (AEAD, FIPS 197)
- **Key Size**: 256 bits
- **Nonce**: 96 bits, derived from position (no reuse)

```rust
fn encrypt_event(event: &Event, dek: &DataKey) -> EncryptedEvent {
    // Nonce derived from position (unique, never reused)
    let nonce = derive_nonce(event.position);

    // Authenticated encryption
    let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(dek.as_ref());
    let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(&nonce, event.data.as_ref())
        .expect("encryption failed");

    EncryptedEvent {
        position: event.position,
        encrypted_data: ciphertext,
        key_id: dek.id,
    }
}

fn derive_nonce(position: LogPosition) -> Nonce {
    let mut nonce = [0u8; 12];
    nonce[..8].copy_from_slice(&position.0.to_le_bytes());
    // Remaining 4 bytes are zero (sufficient uniqueness from position)
    Nonce::from(nonce)
}
```

### Key Rotation

Keys can be rotated without re-encrypting existing data:

1. Generate new DEK
2. New events encrypted with new DEK
3. Old events remain readable with old DEK
4. Old DEK kept until all data using it expires

### Cryptographic Deletion

For GDPR "right to erasure", delete the tenant's KEK:

1. Delete KEK from KMS
2. All DEKs become unrecoverable
3. All tenant data becomes unreadable
4. Log entries remain (for audit) but are cryptographically inaccessible

---

## Retention and Legal Hold

Kimberlite supports configurable retention policies and legal holds.

### Retention Policies

```rust
struct RetentionPolicy {
    /// Minimum retention period
    min_retention: Duration,

    /// Maximum retention period (data deleted after)
    max_retention: Option<Duration>,

    /// Delete method
    deletion_method: DeletionMethod,
}

enum DeletionMethod {
    /// Keep metadata, delete payload
    TombstoneOnly,

    /// Cryptographic deletion (delete keys)
    CryptoDelete,

    /// Physical deletion (for non-regulated data)
    PhysicalDelete,
}
```

### Legal Hold

Legal holds prevent deletion regardless of retention policy:

```rust
struct LegalHold {
    /// Unique identifier for this hold
    hold_id: HoldId,

    /// Which tenant is affected
    tenant_id: TenantId,

    /// Optional: specific streams affected
    streams: Option<Vec<StreamId>>,

    /// Optional: specific time range
    time_range: Option<(Timestamp, Timestamp)>,

    /// Why this hold exists
    reason: String,

    /// Who placed the hold
    placed_by: ActorId,

    /// When the hold was placed
    placed_at: Timestamp,
}
```

### Hold Operations

```sql
-- Place a legal hold
CALL place_legal_hold(
    tenant_id := 123,
    reason := 'Litigation hold - Case #456',
    streams := ARRAY['records', 'activities']
);

-- List active holds
SELECT * FROM __legal_holds WHERE tenant_id = 123;

-- Release a hold
CALL release_legal_hold(hold_id := 'hold_abc123');
```

## Point-in-Time Reconstruction

Any historical state can be reconstructed from the log.

### How It Works

```rust
/// Reconstruct state as of a specific log position
fn reconstruct_at(
    log: &Log,
    target_position: LogPosition,
) -> ProjectionState {
    let mut state = ProjectionState::empty();

    for event in log.iter().take_while(|e| e.position <= target_position) {
        state.apply(&event);
    }

    state
}
```

### Query Interface

```sql
-- Query state as of specific position
SELECT * FROM records AS OF POSITION 12345
WHERE id = 1;

-- Query state as of timestamp
SELECT * FROM records AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-01-15 10:30:00'
WHERE id = 1;

-- Query state as of system time (database time, not event time)
SELECT * FROM records AS OF SYSTEM TIME '2024-01-15 10:30:00'
WHERE id = 1;
```

### Use Cases

| Use Case | Query Type |
|----------|------------|
| Audit investigation | AS OF POSITION (exact state) |
| Compliance report | AS OF TIMESTAMP (business time) |
| Bug investigation | AS OF SYSTEM TIME (when data was committed) |
| GDPR data subject request | Full history export |

## Regulator-Friendly Exports

Kimberlite produces exports suitable for regulatory review.

### Export Formats

```rust
enum ExportFormat {
    /// JSON Lines (one event per line)
    JsonLines,

    /// CSV with full metadata
    Csv,

    /// Parquet (for large exports)
    Parquet,

    /// Native Kimberlite format (for migration)
    Native,
}
```

### Export Command

```bash
# Export tenant data
kimberlite export \
    --tenant 123 \
    --from '2024-01-01' \
    --to '2024-12-31' \
    --format jsonl \
    --output export.jsonl

# Export with cryptographic proof
kimberlite export \
    --tenant 123 \
    --include-proof \
    --output export.jsonl.proof
```

### Export Contents

Each export includes:

1. **Data**: All events in the requested range
2. **Metadata**: Positions, timestamps, actors, correlations
3. **Schema**: Table definitions at each schema version
4. **Proof** (optional): Hash chain verification data

### Proof Structure

```json
{
  "export_id": "exp_abc123",
  "tenant_id": 123,
  "range": {
    "from_position": 1000,
    "to_position": 5000
  },
  "hashes": {
    "first_event_prev_hash": "a3f2c...",
    "last_event_hash": "f2b7d...",
    "merkle_root": "9e8d7..."
  },
  "sealed_checkpoint": {
    "position": 5000,
    "signature": "...",
    "signer": "..."
  }
}
```

A regulator can verify:
1. The hash chain is valid within the export
2. The export connects to a sealed checkpoint
3. No events are missing or modified

## FIPS 140-3 Compliance

Kimberlite uses **FIPS-approved algorithms for all compliance-critical operations**. Internal operations may use additional high-performance algorithms where FIPS compliance is not required.

### Algorithm Selection

| Purpose | Algorithm | FIPS Standard | Status |
|---------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| **Compliance Hashing** | SHA-256 | FIPS 180-4 | ✅ Approved |
| **Internal Hashing** | BLAKE3 | N/A (internal only) | ✅ Performance |
| **Signatures** | Ed25519 | FIPS 186-5 | ✅ Approved |
| **Encryption** | AES-256-GCM | FIPS 197 + SP 800-38D | ✅ Approved |
| **Key Derivation** | HKDF-SHA256 | SP 800-56C | ✅ Approved |
| **Random Numbers** | OS CSPRNG | SP 800-90A/B | ✅ Approved |

### Hash Algorithm Strategy

Kimberlite uses a **boundary-aware hashing strategy** that maintains FIPS compliance for regulatory-critical operations while enabling high-performance hashing internally.

**Compliance Boundary (SHA-256 - FIPS 180-4)**:
- Log record hash chains (tamper evidence)
- Checkpoint sealing signatures
- Audit exports and third-party proofs
- Any data that may be examined by regulators or auditors

**Internal Operations (BLAKE3)**:
- Content addressing and deduplication
- Merkle tree construction for snapshots
- Internal consistency verification
- Streaming message fingerprinting

**Boundary Enforcement**: The `HashPurpose` enum in code prevents accidental use of BLAKE3 for compliance-critical operations:

```rust
match purpose {
    HashPurpose::Compliance => SHA-256,  // Audit trails, exports, proofs
    HashPurpose::Internal => BLAKE3,     // Dedup, Merkle trees, fingerprints
}
```

**Auditor Note**: All externally-verifiable proofs use FIPS-approved SHA-256. BLAKE3 is used only for internal performance optimization and never appears in audit trails, checkpoints, or exported data.

### Why This Approach?

Kimberlite serves healthcare customers — many of whom (HHS / VA / DoD covered entities, federal contractors handling PHI) require FIPS 140-3 validated cryptography:

1. **Clear boundary**: Compliance paths use FIPS-validated primitives; internal hot paths may use faster algorithms
2. **Audit simplicity**: Auditors see FIPS algorithms for all external-facing operations (audit chain, signed exports, BAA-bearing endpoints)
3. **Pressurecraft alignment**: "Simplicity is security" within each boundary
4. **Customer reality**: Federal-touching healthcare (VA, IHS, DoD MTFs, federal-contractor clinics) require FIPS-validated crypto for PHI

### Regulatory Framework Compliance

| Framework | Requirement | Kimberlite Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **HIPAA** | Strong encryption, audit trails | ✅ Fully compliant |
| **PCI DSS** | AES-256, SHA-256 | ✅ Fully compliant |
| **FISMA** | FIPS 140-3 algorithms | ✅ Fully compliant |
| **GDPR** | Strong cryptography | ✅ Fully compliant |
| **SOC 2** | Industry standard crypto | ✅ Fully compliant |
| **21 CFR Part 11** | Electronic signatures, audit trails | ✅ Fully compliant |

**Note**: FIPS 140-3 certification is a post-v1.0 consideration. See [`ROADMAP.md`](../../ROADMAP.md) for the current planning.

### Performance Considerations

The dual-hash strategy optimizes for both compliance and performance:

- **Compliance paths (SHA-256)**: ~500 MB/s is sufficient for audit log throughput since these paths are I/O-bound (fsync dominates)
- **Internal paths (BLAKE3)**: ~3-5x faster than SHA-256, parallel-friendly for large data operations
- **AES-GCM**: Hardware acceleration (AES-NI) provides excellent performance on modern CPUs
- **Best of both**: FIPS compliance where required, maximum performance where not

---

## Summary

Kimberlite provides compliance by construction:

- **Immutable log**: Events cannot be modified or deleted
- **Hash chaining**: Any tampering is detectable
- **Cryptographic sealing**: External verification possible
- **Per-tenant encryption**: Data isolation enforced cryptographically
- **Retention controls**: Legal holds and configurable policies
- **Point-in-time queries**: Any historical state reconstructible
- **Regulator exports**: Verifiable, complete, and portable
- **Transaction idempotency**: Duplicate transactions are impossible; commitment proofs available
- **Recovery transparency**: Explicit tracking of any data loss during recovery

The goal is not just to pass audits, but to make compliance violations architecturally impossible.
